# @uifabric/theme-samples

**Theme samples package for [Office UI Fabric React](https://dev.microsoft.com/fabric)**

This is not a production-ready package and **should never be used in product**. This space is useful for serving as an example for theme definition and for testing new themes before finalizing them for use elsewhere.

To import sample themes:

```js
import { ThemeName } from '@uifabric/theme-samples';
```
