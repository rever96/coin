Representing people in a consistent manner across different user interfaces helps with effortless communication. Using Fabric Persona controls ensure an accurate and consistent experience across apps.

Persona controls display the profile picture and online status of the user. When a user does not have a profile picture, the user's initials sit on top of a background color. In the event that both of these options are unavailable, a generic person icon is shown.

Beside a profile picture, Persona controls can include text elements. The user's full name can show alongside other metadata, such as job title, company, and more.

Persona controls are also available as a performant list view. The `PersonaListView` controls are perfect for listing many people. Examples of this may be an Address Book or a People Picker auto-complete experience.
