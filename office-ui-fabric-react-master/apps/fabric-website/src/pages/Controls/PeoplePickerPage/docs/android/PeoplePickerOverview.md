The `PeoplePicker` is used to select one or more entities, such as people or groups. Entering text in the field prompts a search for recipients from a dropdown list. When a recipient is selected from the list, it is added to the field as a specialized `PersonaChipView` that can be interacted with, deleted, or dragged between fields. The most common example can be seen in the To field of a new email in Outlook Mobile.

The `PeoplePicker` control handles keyboard input, field expanding and collapsing, and truncation automatically.
