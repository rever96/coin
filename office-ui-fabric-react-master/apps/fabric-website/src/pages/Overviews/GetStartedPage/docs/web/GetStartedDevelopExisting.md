Getting started developing with Fabric React is simple!

To quickly try out Fabric React, you can use our "Hello World" templates on [CodePen](https://aka.ms/fabricpen) or [CodeSandbox](https://aka.ms/fabricsandbox).

You can also add Fabric React to an existing project or use one of our starter kits to create a new project.

### Add to existing project

Fabric React is available via the `office-ui-fabric-react` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/office-ui-fabric-react). To use this package in an existing project:

```shell
# with npm
npm install office-ui-fabric-react

# with yarn
yarn add office-ui-fabric-react
```

```jsx
import { PrimaryButton } from 'office-ui-fabric-react';
```
