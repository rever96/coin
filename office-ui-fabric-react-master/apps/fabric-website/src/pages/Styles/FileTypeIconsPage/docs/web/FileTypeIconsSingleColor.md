Fabricâ€™s icon font set also contains single-color file type icons. You use these single-color icons like all other font-based icons in Fabric. For more information, see the [Fabric icons](#/styles/web/icons) page or refer to the following example:

```html
<i class="ms-Icon ms-Icon--AccessLogo" aria-hidden="true"></i>
```
