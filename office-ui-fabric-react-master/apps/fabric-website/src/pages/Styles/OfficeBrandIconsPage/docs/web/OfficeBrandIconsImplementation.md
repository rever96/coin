To use the Office and Office 365 multicolor brand icons, select the format and size that best meets your needs. Fabric includes a media query that automatically selects the right image file for the pixel density of the screen youâ€™re targeting.

The following code shows you how to specify a product icon by extension, item type, icon size, and image type using Fabric's `<Icon>` component:

```jsx
// Sample code for displaying an Word 96x96px Icon
<div class="ms-BrandIcon--icon96 ms-BrandIcon--word" />
```
