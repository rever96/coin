### What’s new in Fabric 7?

We’ve updated Fabric to include a new set of Web Fluent design styles, which include colors, type, depth and motion which are applied to the standard set of Fabric controls. These include:

- Colors are an updated, shared set used in common components such as personas, sites, groups and calendar events. We’ve also updated the Neutrals to be warmer and more approachable.
- Typography has been updated to a new common type ramp used across core Microsoft apps, leveraging the latest type weights from Fluent.
- Depth styles now include a common set of shadow levels from Fluent, and are applied to context menus, dialogs, panels, etc.
- Motion styles have been updated to the latest Fluent styles and are available to be used inside of your applications.

### Upgrading to Fabric 7

Along with a visual refresh, Fabric 7 updates the minimum required version of React to 16.8.1 and TypeScript to 3.3. It also includes a number of behavior improvements and removes old deprecated props. For a full rundown of these changes, and upgrade instructions, see the [release notes](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/wiki/Fabric-7) on our wiki.
