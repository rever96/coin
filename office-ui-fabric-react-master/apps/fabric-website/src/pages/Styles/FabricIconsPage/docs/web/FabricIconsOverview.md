Fabric uses a custom font for its iconography. This font contains glyphs that you can scale, color, and style in any way. There are also mirrored icons available for right-to-left localization. You can also download and install the icon font to use it with various design apps like Sketch, Figma, or Adobe XD.

**The icons on this page refer to the general-use monoline icons. See the [brand icons page](#/styles/web/office-brand-icons) for multi-color product icons and the [file type icons page](#/styles/web/file-type-icons) for document icons.**

### When should I use Fabric icons?

It is recommended to use Fabric icons for command bars, navigation or status indicators. If you need icons to represent Office apps, see the [Office brand icons page](#/styles/web/office-brand-icons) . If you are representing files or digital content, see the [file type icons page](#/styles/web/file-type-icons).
